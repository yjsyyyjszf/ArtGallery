Creates unique digital object authenticated using keys/passwords (blockchain). The digital object is an unalterable folder of files ( images, videos, audios, codes, etc) • User-attached information about the digital object’s intent and relationships • Stores a ledger of information of the digital objects interactions from the moment of its creation (e.g views, transfers, edited copies) without compromising the original authenticated file. (this ledger may someday be used to evaluate a type of value/provenance)


Run npm start to run the program.

This is a monolithic node.js application. All the html/css files are in public folder
